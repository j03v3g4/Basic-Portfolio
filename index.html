    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>I sincerely appreciate you taking the time to visit my portfolio!</p>
    <p>I am a software developer with years of experience working in fast-paced, startup environments. Looking to help customers leverage data to maximize the efficiency of their business practices, I taught myself MYSQL and simply fell in love with code. Having built a career on my innate ability to recognize patterns and solve complex problems, coding was a natural avenue for me. Once I got started, I simply never looked back!</p>
